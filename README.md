# Welcome!

Welcome to the course Quantitative Methods at the University of Mannheim. In this course we will use the open-source software $\texttt{R}$ and RStudio. Before we get started with the lecture on Wednesday, we would like you to install both $\texttt{R}$ and RStudio on your computer. In this document we provide you detailed instructions to install these programs. 

To facilitate a convenient workflow, we will integrate the course in GitHub. By now, you should have already received an invitation mail.

## What is R?

R is a programming language designed to help you perform statistical analysis, create graphics, and later on write your own statistical software. R is becoming increasingly popular and knowledge of R will help you in the job market. R is probably the most versatile statistical tool out there (and its free and open source so you can literally use it anywhere).

## What is RStudio?

RStudio is very good graphical user interface for R and will be the program which we will use during the lab sessions. In recent years a growing number of features have been added to this graphical user interface, which makes it the preferred choice for learning R especially among beginners.
