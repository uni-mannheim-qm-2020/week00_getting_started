## Welcome!

Welcome to the course Quantitative Methods at the University of Mannheim. In this course we will use the open-source software `R` and RStudio. Before we get started with the lecture on Wednesday, we would like you to install both `R` and RStudio on your computer. In this document we provide you detailed instructions to install these programs. 

To facilitate an efficient workflow, we will integrate Github into the course. By now, you should have already received an invitation mail.

## What is `R`?

`R` is a programming language designed to help you perform statistical analysis, create graphics, and later on write your own statistical software. `R` is becoming increasingly popular and knowledge of `R` will help you in the job market. `R` is probably the most versatile statistical tool out there (and its free and open source so you can literally use it anywhere).

## What is RStudio?

RStudio is very good graphical user interface for `R` and will be the program which we will use during the lab sessions. In recent years a growing number of features have been added to this graphical user interface, which makes it the preferred choice for learning `R` especially among beginners.

## What are git and GitHub?

`git` is a version control system that makes it easy to track changes and work on code collaboratively. GitHub is a hosting service for `git`. You can think of it like a public Dropbox for code. As a student, you even get unlimited private repositories which you can use if you donâ€™t feel like sharing your code with the rest of the world (yet).
